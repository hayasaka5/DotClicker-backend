### DotClicker

DotClicker is a fast-paced aim training game designed to improve your precision and reaction time. Similar to an aim booster, DotClicker challenges players to click on randomly appearing dots as quickly as possible, all while competing to achieve the highest score.

This game features an online multiplayer mode where players can create or join rooms, compete with others, and interact in real-time. The game is built with a modern tech stack, including:

- **Frontend:** React.js for the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive gaming experience.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js to handle the server-side logic, manage rooms, and handle player connections.
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket integration for real-time player interactions and multiplayer functionality.
- **Styling:** SCSS for scalable and maintainable styles.
  
The gameplay is simple yet highly engaging: players need to click on the targets that appear on the screen to gain points, and the game tracks their accuracy and speed. As the player progresses, the difficulty level increases, making the game more challenging.

With a clean, user-friendly design and the ability to compete with friends or random players in online multiplayer mode, DotClicker is an exciting way to train your aim and reflexes.
